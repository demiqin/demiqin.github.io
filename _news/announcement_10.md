ðŸš€ Iâ€™ve joined NREL's Data, Analysis, and Visualization (DAV) team as a Research Scientist! Iâ€™m excited to work on ML, TDA, and visualization for energy systems, integrating them with high-performance and immersive computing tools. If youâ€™re interested in collaboration, whether in energy analytics, renewable systems modeling, or computational visualization, please reach out at [demi.qin@nrel.gov](mailto:demi.qin@nrel.gov).
