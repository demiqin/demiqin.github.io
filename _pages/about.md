Hello! Welcome to the space of 秦瑜, and you can call me Demi 👋

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Tulane University, specializing in machine learning, topological data analysis, and advanced visualization. My dissertation, titled [Metric Learning on Topological Descriptors](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFNSh0oR60/j7udMbLvBw3E9MfwJKfgGA/view?utm_content=DAFNSh0oR60&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink#2) is advised by Prof. [Brian Summa](https://tulanevisgraphics.bitbucket.io/) and Prof. [Carola Wenk](https://www.cs.tulane.edu/~carola/).

  My research falls at the intersection of **machine learning (ML), visualization (VIS) and topological data analysis (TDA)**. I aim to push the boundaries of how we understand and interpret complex data efficiently. Using advanced visualization techniques and ML, I enhance large data analysis and explore the shapes and geometries of complex datasets, from scalar fields and images to 3D shapes and graphs. These techniques enable scalable data capture and analysis, potentially improving decisions that affect billions daily.<br>
  
  My work finds applications in diverse areas: enhancing medical imaging for better diagnostics, advancing climate models for precise weather forecasting and climate change analysis, and increasing efficiency in supply chain management.

<!-- In my research, I push the boundaries of how we understand and interpret complex datasets efficiently. I leverage **machine learning** and **visualization** to understand data structures and similarities from a **topological** perspective. I create models that not only measure data similarities at scale but also explain the 'why' behind these similarities. My work finds applications in diverse areas: enhancing medical imaging techniques for better diagnostic accuracy, advancing our understanding of climate models for more precise weather forecasting and climate change analysis, and increasing efficiency in supply chain management. 

My research falls at the intersection of **machine learning (ML), topological data analysis (TDA), and visualization (VIS)**. I aim to push the boundaries of how we understand and interpret complex data efficiently. Specifically, I develop ML methods to improve large data analysis and visualization from a topological perspective. 

I leverage advanced visualization techniques and ML to better understand shapes and geometry in complex datasets, such as scalar fields and graphs. These techniques offer new opportunities to capture and analyze data at scale, potentially improving decisions that affect billions daily. However, these techniques also introduce new challenges, such as how to utilize them to improve ML models without information loss([TDA Workshop at NeurIPS'2020](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=X1bxKJo5_qL)), how to comparing them effectively with different data structures ([VIS'2021](https://tulanevisgraphics.bitbucket.io/publications/pd_hash/index.html),[arXiv'2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05879)), visualize the topological importance in classification ([TopoInVis'2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13185)), and extract precise signals from diverse datasets like supply chain([Stanford Graph Learning Workshop'2023](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10rps8ooex9dW1JKcmeFAZc_-O7JyIjAK/view)), climate model ([EnergyVis'2023](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/87355.pdf)), and medical imaging ([QuBBD Project](https://www.cs.tulane.edu/~carola/research/qubbd.html)). 

To address these challenges, I create models that not only measure data similarities at scale but also explain the ‘why’ behind these similarities. My work finds applications in diverse areas: enhancing medical imaging for better diagnostics, advancing climate models for precise weather forecasting and climate change analysis, and increasing efficiency in supply chain management. -->
